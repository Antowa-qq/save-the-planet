              With only around 100 adults left in the wild, the Amur leopard could be the most endangered big cat
              on Earth.
            </p>

            <p>
              Wild Amur leopards are now only found in the border areas between the Russian Far East and north-east
              China, and possibly North Korea.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most are in Russia, with a few in China. Their range is smaller than 2,500 sq km – that’s an area
              smaller than Dorset.
            </p>

            <p>They prefer mature forest and avoid open grasslands or populated areas.</p>

              The Javan Rhino is the rarest of the rhino species with 74 animals currently surviving only in
              Indonesia.
            </p>

            <p>
              Javan rhinos are now found only in Indonesia’s Ujung Kulon National Park, where the population
              appears to have stabilized, largely because they are guarded by Rhino Protection Units. There has
              been no poaching in Ujung Kulon in more than 20 years.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because of this, their population has been slowly but steadily increasing and IRF is working with
              local partner YABI to create more suitable habitat for them so their population can continue to grow.

              Today, around 1,063 mountain gorillas are thought to exist in the wild, and the future is looking

            </p>

            <p>
              Since 1981, the gorilla population has almost doubled. 30 years ago, experts feared they were soon to
              be extinct. Thanks to intensive conservation efforts, mountain gorillas were moved from 'critically
              endangered' to 'endangered' on the IUCN red list in 2018.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, illegal poaching, pollution, habitat deforestation, fragmentation and diseases caught from
              humans are still threatening their populations. They are often poached for their meat, and younger
              gorillas can be caught in snares meant for other animals. War and civil unrest have also impacted
              negatively on the gorillas.

              The vaquita is now on the brink of extinction with fewer than 19 remaining as of summer 2018. Recent
              acoustic surveys in Fall 2020 indicate the continued presence of vaquitas. Analysis of the 2011 to

              Gharials, sometimes called gavials, are a type of Asian crocodilian distinguished by their long, thin
              snouts. Gharials live in clear freshwater river systems, congregating at river bends where the water
              is deeper..

              Once found from Pakistan to Myanmar, the reptile's range has shrunk to two countries: India, along

            </p>

            <p>
              Since the 1940s, the gharial's numbers have declined as much as 98 percent due to hunting for
              traditional medicine and drastic changes to their freshwater habitats. For instance, people have
              manipulated the flow of rivers, causing certain areas to dry out and making it more difficult for
              water-reliant gharials to survive. Young gharials are also susceptible to being caught in fishing
              nets, which can lead to injury or drowning.

              cats in the world and today, an estimated 500 – 550 can be found in the Russian Far East with a small
              number ranging across the border into China and possibly North Korea.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the 1940s, it was on the brink of extinction with fewer than 50 individuals remaining in the wild.
              This was due to decades of almost continual political instability with the Russian Revolution and the
              formation of the Soviet Union.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 1947 after WW2, Russia became the first country to ban tiger hunting and offer tigers full
              protection. Hunting of the main prey species, boar and deer, became restricted by annual quota based
              on the results of population counts. Poaching of tigers became relatively rare, because there was no
              market for skins and other tiger products, although hunters on occasion killed their “competitor”
              when an opportunity presented itself.

              Right whales are the rarest of all large whales. There are several species, but all are identified by
              enormous heads, which can measure up to one-third of their total body length
            </p>

            <p>
              Right whales were named by whalers who identified them as the “right” whale to kill on a hunt. These
              leviathans had enormous value for their plentiful oil and baleen, which were used for corsets, buggy
              whips, and other contrivances. Because of their thick blubber, right whales also float
              accommodatingly after they have been killed. Populations of these whales were decimated during the
              whaling heydays of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. During this period they came close to
              extinction.Because females do not become sexually mature until ten years of age and give birth to a
              single calf after a yearlong pregnancy, populations grow slowly.
            </p>

            <p>
              All species of right whales have enjoyed complete international protection since 1949. Southern right
              whales have shown some encouraging population growth since their protection. Northern right whales
              are the most at-risk of all large whales.

              They also share their habitat with other critically endangered species, such as the Sumatran tiger

              Discovered in 1870, it was believed to have become extinct by the early twentieth century. It was

              Completely dependent on this low-energy food source, the lemur must lead a very sedentary lifestyle
              and spend much of its time eating. As with many specialist species, this lemur is unable to adapt to
